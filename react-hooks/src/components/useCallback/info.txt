all the components while exporting should be wrapped in React.memo

export default React.memo(Title) 


useCallback(when func passed as prop to component) : 
function before the re-render 
is diff from func after the re-render and if this func
is prop to some component(means this function is passed 
as prop to some component) then React.memo will see the 
prop has changed and will not stop the re-render. 

const incrementAge = useCallback(() => {
    setAge(age + 1)
}, [])
